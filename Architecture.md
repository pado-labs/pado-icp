# Enable PADO on Internet Computer 

## About PADO 

### the vision
PADO is a zkAttestation protocol, dedicated to bringing Internet data into web3 smart contracts, expanding the capabilities of smart contracts, and enabling the monetization of personal data within data flows under privacy protection. PADO protocol uses advanced cryptography techniques including secure multi-party computation (MPC) and zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP) to fulfill the objectives. In particular, PADO allows users to attest their off-chain data in an authentic and privacy-preserving manner, and tp further create their attestations, a.k.a., data proofs, which can be shared and accessed by other parties. 

In the process of sharing this information, two critical security properties must be guaranteed.

**Authenticity**: It is essential to ensure that user data originates from a specific source and remains unaltered during the sharing process. With PADO, we preserve the data origin and integrity, establishing authenticity.

**Privacy**: Our goal is to handle private information appropriately. Specifically, we adhere to data minimization principles by using zero-knowledge proofs when performing data computations to protect privacy.
